In this repository, you can find the group project for the 'Mathematical Modelling for Neuroscience' course held at Bocconi University by Professor Alessandro Sanzeni.

*Research Question*: "How does neuronal spike activity vary among different brain regions in response to specific stimuli in mice, and can these variations be accurately classified to map functional brain regions?"
